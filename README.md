# Gender Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect gender from facial images. It demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques in the domain of image classification, specifically focused on gender prediction.

---

## Features
- Gender classification from facial images using a trained CNN model.
- Easy-to-use and well-commented Jupyter notebooks for training and inference.
- Modular code structure for training, evaluating, and predicting.


## Model Architecture

The model is built using the Sequential API from `tensorflow.keras`. It consists of:
- Multiple convolutional and pooling layers
- Flatten and Dense layers
- Final output layer for binary classification (male/female)
